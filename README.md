# Build A Portfolio Website

With all of the projects you will be working on here at Lambda School, you will need somewhere to house them!  There is no better opportunity to learn and show off your skills than a beautiful portfolio website.  

You have the ability to write HTML, CSS, and responsive media queries.  You also know how to identify and write responsive units.  It's time to put that knowledge into action by reading someone else's code and adding your own flavor.  You will be building a portfolio website from a template found on [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/).

## Project Set Up

### Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add PM as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch on the clone: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on the `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

### Follow these steps to download your template and start the project:

- [ ] Navigate here: [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/)

	- [https://html5up.net/miniport](https://html5up.net/miniport)
	- [https://html5up.net/dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension)

- [ ] Unzip the code and copy the site to your git repository that you just set up
  * Note that we won't be utilizing the pre processed CSS structure, you can just ignore any folder with LESS or SASS (SCSS) in it.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
